% remote) through data assimilation and enhancing forecasting skills.

\subsection{Summary}
`

Our oceans host enormous biodiversity, provide multiple ecosystem
services, sustain vibrant economies, and play a significant role in
climate regulation, but are threatened by human activity and climate
change.  We need a \textbf{sustained}, \textbf{persistent}, and
\textbf{affordable} data gathering and assimilating capability to help
us understand and monitor how key processes such as acidification,
hypoxia, toxic blooms, pollution and erosion (amongst others) are
impacting global ocean sustainability and stewardship.  In coastal
regions, this is especially important, because these areas mediate
most of the interactions between a significant percentage of the world
population and the oceans.

Urban population growth has exacerbated the pressures on the coastal
ecosystem.  For example, resultant toxic blooms and oxygen depletion
have had deleterious effects on fisheries and other critical resources
that coastal populations depend on, while also impacting human
health. Furthermore, extreme weather events induced by climate change
will only hasten the worsening of water quality in these areas because
of enhanced runoff, coastal erosion and storm surges. An integrative
sea management approach and the protection of natural capital and
marine ecosystem resources can only be achieved with the help of
coordinated observations from space, aerial, surface and underwater
robots guided by Artificial Intelligence (AI).
% while providing continual and reliable oceanographic data.

Many large telescopes point toward the heavens, but no such
observational system exists for looking at and into our oceans.  Our
mission is to build a portable, robotic observatory for observing,
analyzing and managing the health of our endangered coastal waters
which can be rapidly deployed anywhere in the world
(Fig. \ref{fig:mega-cities}).

\vspace*{-0.2cm}
\subsection{The Idea}

\pro (A Portable Robotic Observatory for Coordinated Oceanographic
Observations) will be a modular system with bespoke approaches related
to water quality in the world's coastal zones with mega-cities. It
will integrate state-of-the-art hardware including a small satellite
(\smle's) constellation, in-situ air, surface and underwater vehicles
with software to control and visualize the information gathered. With
frequent revisit times over a region by a constellation of \smle's,
coupled with latest smart and adaptive AI techniques, robots can
provide systematic and opportune observations in near real-time.

% robotic technologies reduces
% deployment time to provide opportune solutions and consequently,
% leverages the latest techniques in AI, Robotics and software
% engineering.


% It
% will provide information for water quality measurements suitable for
% lay persons who can obtain and interpret near real-time (hours) data
% visualized at spatial and temporal scales to provide actionable
% information to deal with coastal pollution, erosion, toxic waters and
% sediment laden plumes.

  \caption{Coastal zones are impacted by natural and human-induced
    activities leading to oxygen depleted 'dead' zones, toxic algal
    blooms, pollution and coastal erosion. \pro will use an ensemble
    of small satellites, aerial, surface and underwater vehicles along
    with predictive shore-side ocean models, to observe the coastal
    ocean over sustained periods of time to provide real-time warning
    and situational awareness of impactful changes to human health,
    biodiversity and ecosystem services. Note the terms UAV: unmanned
    aerial vehicle, ASV: autonomous surface vehicle, AUV: autonomous
    underwater vehicle, CODAR: Coastal High-Frequency (HF) Radar.}

\end{figure}

Using \proe, stakeholders across governments, industry, science,
nonprofits and citizenry will make use of layered views ranging from
basic visuals to the complex queries needed for effective management
of resources and increased scientific knowledge.  Ocean models in the
cloud, will integrate the information collected from multiple
platforms, robotic vehicles as well as satellite remote sensing, so as
to predict the evolution of oceanographic conditions. This integration
will provide a unified picture of the surveyed water volume capturing
the diversity of phenomenon and connect that to natural ocean
variability. The model-data assimilated from robotic platforms will in
turn allow us to improve our understanding of the complex ocean flows
and increase predictive skill.
% Natural events such as storm surges, tsunamis and upwelled waters
% impact such mega-city coastal communities in addition. Turbulence in
% the upper water-column with potential injection of nutrients, either
% from the benthic or open ocean waters, can often result in sudden
% outgrowth of harmful algal blooms, or stirring up human-induced
% pollution in such coastal areas.

% In both human and nature induced events, the resulting mix can make it
% unsafe for any form of human activity often with no obvious and
% expected visible sign of near and present danger to local communities.
% However, the consequences can reverberate with mass scale die-off of
% marine life, poisoned shellfish and coastal wildlife and as well as
% causing neurological damage or fatalities to the human population on
% consuming seafood or using beaches for recreation.

% Current forms of monitoring are based on sensors (if present) spaced
% well apart, periodic human-made measurements that can be impacted by
% harsh weather and which typically sub-sample such dynamic coastal
% environments.

% \pro will integrate state-of-the-art hardware including a small
% satellite (\smle) constellation, in-situ air, surface and underwater
% vehicles with software to control and visualize information derived
% from these assets.  The use of \smle's and smart robotic technologies
% reduces deployment time to provide opportune solutions and
% consequently leverages the latest techniques in AI, Robotics and
% software engineering. Coordinated perspectives across different
% synoptic spatial and temporal scales in turn will provide a
% hyper-realistic situational assessment to stakeholders including those
% who drive policy making for human health.

% In the report, “Global Marine Trends 2030”, Lloyds Register predicts
% that by 2030, the coastal ocean will be “almost unrecognizable”. As we
% enter the United Nations “Decade of the Ocean”, \pro will broaden and
% deepen knowledge that will aid and augment global ocean sustainability
% and stewardship, and the management of our Urban Seas.

\subsection{Why now?}

With the onset of a climate crisis, the oceans are changing rapidly in
ways we do not understand. In the report, ``Global Marine Trends
2030'', Lloyds Register predicts that by 2030, the coastal ocean will
be ``almost unrecognizable''. There is an urgent need to develop and
deploy new smart observational methods to provide information at
scales that matter to the 600 million people living along the coast
within 10 meters of sea level.  Predicting change and providing early
warning of hazardous events is essential for the well-being of an
increasingly vulnerable coastal ecosystem. It is also in line with the
goals of the 2021-2030 UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable
Development.

% The oceans cover more than 70\% of the earth's surface. The base of
% the human food-chain starts with tiny phytoplankton which generate the
% oxygen for every other breath we take.  With the onset of a climate
% crisis, the oceans are changing rapidly in ways we do not
% understand. There is an urgent need to develop and deploy new smart
% observational methods to provide information at scales that matter to
% the 600 million people living along the coast within 10 meters of the
% sea level.  Predicting change and providing early warning of hazardous
% events, including poor water quality, tainted fish stocks and
% intensifying coastal erosion, is essential for the well-being of an
% increasingly vulnerable coastal ecosystem. It is also in line with the
% goals of the 2021-2030 UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable
% Development.

% By leveraging rapid advances in technology, \pro will field an
% innovative system of small satellites and robust autonomous in-situ
% platforms for obtaining unprecedented views of coastal oceans and
% atmospheric and land interfaces. It will aid in the understanding and
% monitoring of coastal waters so that they can be explored and utilized
% in a sustainable and informed manner.

% \pro will leap-frog the traditional incremental and siloed methods in
% ocean observation by leveraging modern computational methods in data
% science, autonomous robotics and smart sensors. The density and
% diversity of observations will change by an order of magnitude, the
% temporal scales of coastal observations will change from weeks (for
% traditional shipboard sampling) or days (for existing satellite data)
% to hours and minutes with the provision of real-time information.


\vspace*{-0.2cm}
\subsection{What is the novelty?}

\pro is different from traditional methods for observing the coastal
ocean, which are inefficient, not cost-effective, too sparse in space,
too sporadic in time or too localized. There is poor integration and
assimilation of multiple data sources especially between those made
in-situ and those made by satellites to produce actionable knowledge.

\pro leap-frogs current methods by delivering predictive modeling,
Machine Learning and AI driven analytical capabilities, augmented by
visualization techniques that are non-existent in other interventions.
The density and diversity of observations will change by an order of
magnitude, the temporal scales of coastal observations will change
from weeks or days to \emph{hours and minutes} with the provision of
near real-time information. Techniques in AI will adapt the
information depending on the kind of user, from well-informed
scientists, to the lay person curious about how beach conditions might
impact her leisure.

In the process of providing actionable knowledge, \pro will enable new
modes of management and new understanding about coastal ocean
processes in ways simply not possible before. \pro will allow citizens
to develop critical understanding of the rapid change taking place in
their Urban Seas and to ‘connect the dots’ between human activity and
the effect on the environment around them. Citizen scientists will be
engaged in generating new observations and be able to derive new
knowledge about how ocean processes work. Scientists will be able to
pose (and answer) new questions that could not have been asked
before. And policy makers will have the tools to make informed
decisions in time scales that matter, while developing truly
integrative policies on ocean sustainability and
stewardship. % \pro will serve as a replicable blueprint for Ocean
% observation in targeting integration, synthesis, cost-effectiveness
% and scalability.

% While some coastal ocean observatories use a limited number of robotic
% assets or remote sensing data, \pro is unique in the range and
% diversity of how these sensors are deployed, how data is integrated
% and synthesized, and how citizen engagement is used to improve the
% value of the output.  Additionally \pro provides an integrative
% open-source framework to connect robots, services and users in a
% seamless manner that is both scalable and replicable, providing a
% blueprint for other initiatives worldwide. It leap-frogs current
% methods by delivering 21st century predictive modeling, learning and
% analytical capabilities, which are supported by AI and visualization
% techniques that are non-existent in other interventions.

\subsection{Governance and Execution}

The governing board of \pro will consist of prominent strategic
advisors from the US and Europe including stakeholders and funders. In
addition, the project principals will be aided and advised by a
scientific advisory board consisting of technologists, ocean going
scientists, ecologists and policy makers from the US, Europe and
targeted coastal states. 

The project itself will be based in Porto, Portugal for a number of
important reasons including the existence marine robotic development
and testing infrastructure, a skilled tech-savvy work force,
university support and overall cost-effectiveness.
